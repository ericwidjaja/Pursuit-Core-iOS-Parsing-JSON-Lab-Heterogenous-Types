# Pursuit-Core-iOS-Parsing-JSON-Lab-Heterogenous-Types

Build an app to show users from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=100).

Your app must include their `postcode` which can be either a `String` or an `Int`.

Build two models:

- One using Codable
- One without Codable, using only downcasting
